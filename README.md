LockFreeAlgorithms
==================

Writing Concurrent Code with Lock-Free Algorithms, Martin Thompson, Instil training

Backed by many years of hard-won experience, Martin has created a truly inspiring and challenging course for Java and C++ programmers interested in building low-latency, high-throughput systems.

Taking a unique hardware-up approach, Martin will teach you how to build code that reaches world-class performance levels.

About The Trainer
==================
Martin Thompson is one of the world’s foremost experts on concurrency and low-latency software.

Having spent many years designing and developing systems for some of the busiest exchanges in the world, Martin now works as an independent consultant and trainer.

Martin is in huge demand both as a conference speaker and as a trainer, and has been packing in the crowds at JavaOne, QCon, GOTO, and much more besides.

Pre-requisites
==================
Ideally you should bring a Linux-based laptop capable of running at least 4 concurrent threads. That is, a quad core or dual core with hyperthreading. You should also have Java 7 and your favourite IDE installed. Everything else, including lunch, will be provided.

Content
==================
By the end of this course candidates will have acquired a new in-depth knowledge of concurrent programming that allows them to develop data structures such as queues, executors, and shared memory IPC transports that significantly out perform any products currently available.

In addition to learning the basic techniques of building high-performance data structures, a performance testing and profiling discipline will be introduced that is fundamental to working at the extremes of systems performance.
